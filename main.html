	<b><h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1></b>
	<p>Hello friends,

My name is Tifu Kelison, I'm from Bamenda, Cameroon. As a child I've always lived with and around computers and as such I didn't have much of a choice but to like them or it. Destroyed a few, got scolded at😅 😅 😅 .

Since i was always around computers, I had to take it in as something in the blood. So how I found out that I want to be a developer happened in a funny way. See the thing was I saw my cousin (Ndi Cedric), coding and he was looking all cool at that particular instant.(You know, like he is the fastest typist I've ever seen).

Then I stopped him and asked "What're you doing", he explained it to me though but I had no clue about what he was talking about 😅😅 . After that I asked if he had courses on html and css and he said yes. Later on in the day I opted to transfer the courses to my own machine, and that was when my own journey started. So one day later, I took the time to google about this developer stuff, and I was amazed at what I found. I'll be sharing with you what I found so that if you're also thinking about being a developer, it will make the process easy for you.

But before that I just have to say, after seeing what a day in the life of a software developer looked like, i then knew that I wanted that life.

After seeing what I had gone through on the internet, I was thrilled about joining the already existing developers. Here's what I had found out.

There are developer jobs everywhere.🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️
I found out that the need for developers in currently increasing in the world and I just want to contribute to help others grow too. From that very day I started having dreams about working at Google. I discovered that there are a lot of opportunities out there just waiting for you to lay your hands on.

With effort, any thing is possible.

2.Great Income💰💰💰

One of the best things I saw about being a developer. I was totally amazed at the salary that I was shown. I found out that If I were to be a developer, I'd be getting $73,999 / Year according to payscale.com

Creativity😋😋😋
That is, I get to be creative and create powerful tools to help people like I've always wanted to. I discovered that creativity has no limit in this developer world and I love being creative. I also get to face challenges, for example, I code and then I get stuck, after some time, I come back, think about the problem and see how to go about it. When it is solved, I feel so happy. It's that feeling that I love about coding.</p>
